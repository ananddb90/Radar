DESCRIPTION OF DATA IN FILE data5.mat AND data5_mys.matPulse length = 10 microsecondsChirp bandwidth = 10 MhzSampling rate = 12 Msamples/secWe are simulating 20 pulses at an RF of 10 GHzand a PRF of 10 kHz, giving a PRI of 100 usec.The range window limits are 12 to 40 usec.The unambiguous velocity interval is 150 m/s.The range window starts at 1.8 km.The range window ends at 6 km.The unambiguous range interval is 15 km.There are 4 targets with the following parameters:  range=  2.5 km, SNR=      7 dB, rel_RCS=      0 dB, vel=    -52.5 m/s  range=  3.4 km, SNR=      3 dB, rel_RCS=  -9.34 dB, vel=    -37.5 m/s  range=  3.4 km, SNR=     10 dB, rel_RCS=  -2.34 dB, vel=     22.5 m/s  range=  4.3 km, SNR=      0 dB, rel_RCS=  -16.4 dB, vel=     67.5 m/s
