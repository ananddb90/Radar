DESCRIPTION OF DATA IN FILE data3.mat AND data3_mys.matPulse length = 10 microsecondsChirp bandwidth = 10 MhzSampling rate = 12 Msamples/secWe are simulating 20 pulses at an RF of 10 GHzand a PRF of 10 kHz, giving a PRI of 100 usec.The range window limits are 12 to 40 usec.The unambiguous velocity interval is 150 m/s.The range window starts at 1.8 km.The range window ends at 6 km.The unambiguous range interval is 15 km.There are 4 targets with the following parameters:  range=  2.1 km, SNR=      3 dB, rel_RCS=      0 dB, vel=      -30 m/s  range=  2.1 km, SNR=     -3 dB, rel_RCS=     -6 dB, vel=     67.5 m/s  range=  3.2 km, SNR=     10 dB, rel_RCS= -0.317 dB, vel=     22.5 m/s  range=  4.4 km, SNR=      0 dB, rel_RCS=  -15.8 dB, vel=      -30 m/s
