ECE410 Radar Project 2 - Kelvin Lin 2013

prj2.m - main project test bench; was used to generate data and graphs. Includes some observations on results obtained through experimentation in comments.
prj2Writeup.pdf - the writeup

custom functions
mclutter(CNR) - a copy of the clutter generation code provided, but allows user input for CNR
mdatac(CNR) - creates data with a user defined CNR value
pdatanpc - processes the data with MTI disabled
mdatacr(CNR) - creates an grid of targets. Adds clutter at a given CNR.
pdatacr - processes the data with all graphs suppressed except the pulse doppler contour of the processed data.
mdataslow(lv) - generates data with a minimum velocity of lv*15 m/s
mdatabw(CNR,W) - generates data with user input CNR and chirp bandwidth W
pdatabw - processes data with range bin plots disabled. (line 307)

The following folders contain graphs and data relevant to the writeup:
Test Effectiveness of MTI
Bandwidth Games

The folder labeled plot2svg contains a function which converts a matlab.fig file into a .svg vector graphics file.
obtained from the matlab file exchange

All functions needed to run the code in prj2.m are located in the main folder.
